Project 3 is an attempt to create a device to aid the visually impaired using an RTOS system. 
It utilizes a vibration motor and an infared sensor to create a feedback system that allows
someone with poor or no eyesight to detect objects without touching them.
The design also incorporates a red and green LED which fill the same roll as the vibration motor. 
Red activates if the sensor is near an object, and green activates if it is not.
These LEDs both allow a user with poor but still functional eyesight to have a second method of detection, 
aswell as a readily available method to check for a defective motor.
