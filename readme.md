About: 
This is a repository for the class CSE321 Real time embedded operating system. 
It will contain all projects for the class and each will have it's own folder.

Project 1 contains a template for main files and low quality code that has been correctd.

Project 2 contains an implementation of a countdown timer that inputs from a keypad and outputs to a LCD
Upon completion, it will act as a portfolio of various interactions with the Nucleo. 

Project 3 contains an implemention for an RTOS system that provides vibrational feedback when near an object to help the visually impaired. 
It consists of a vibration motor and an infared sensor that detects when the system is near an object.
This can, in theory, allow a visually impaired person to detect if they are near an object.
